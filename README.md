# Imports of Goods Analysis

China is U.S.â€™s biggest trade partner, and a large share of consumer goods sold in the U.S. are still manufactured in China. Additionally, the consumption of the average American is a powerful force that can shape many financial dynamics. Using the three time series: 
1. U.S. Imports of Goods by Customs Basis from China: Monthly, non-seasonally-adjusted
data on U.S. imports of Chinese goods by customs basis, in millions of dollars.
2. Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees, Total Pri- vate: Monthly, non-seasonally-adjusted data on average hourly earnings of production and non- supervisory employees in the U.S. private sector, in dollars per hour.
3. Industrial Production: Non-Durable Nonenergy Consumer Goods: Monthly, non- seasonally-adjusted industrial production index for non-durable nonenergy consumer goods in the U.S., as an index based upon the 2017 value being 100.

Models such as ARIMA models, exponential smoothing, multiple regression with the causal model, and multiple regression with dummy variables and polynomials only were explored to determine which models performs the best forecast.
